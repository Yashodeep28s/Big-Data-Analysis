Blinkit Orders Data Analysis – Task 1
This project is part of my internship work, where I explored and analysed Blinkit’s orders dataset to uncover useful business insights. The main aim was to understand order patterns, customer behaviour, and city-level performance using Python and Dask, a tool that makes working with large datasets fast and efficient.

The dataset included information on orders, customers, and cities. I started by loading the data, checking its structure, and cleaning it so it was consistent and ready for analysis. This included fixing missing values, aligning column names, and joining the different tables together. Using Dask made it easy to handle the dataset smoothly without running into memory issues, while still using pandas-style code.

For the analysis, I focused on a few key questions:

Which cities have the highest order volumes?

How do customers differ in their ordering activity?

What patterns stand out that Blinkit could use for decision-making?

By grouping and aggregating the data, I found the top-performing cities in terms of orders, identified variations in customer order counts, and observed where Blinkit’s demand is most concentrated. These insights can help in planning marketing strategies, allocating delivery resources, and deciding where expansion might be most profitable.

Tools Used:

Python

Dask (for scalable data processing)

Pandas (for smaller checks)

Jupyter Notebook (for interactive analysis)

This task lays the groundwork for more advanced analysis and machine learning, which I will work on in Task 2. The cleaned, well-structured dataset from this stage will be the foundation for predictive models that can guide Blinkit’s business growth.
